# Hekaton (WIP)

> [T]he [Hecatoncheires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecatoncheires) were three monstrous giants, of enormous size and strength, each with fifty heads and one hundred arms

## Intro

> ℹ️ This project is a work in progress.  I plan on working on it on and off!

Hekaton is a CLI performance testing tool that uses scenarios defined in YAML.

After searching for easy to use, lightweight open source tools for performance testing, I found that most tools fell into two categories:

1. **Too basic**; focused on raw load testing and do not simulate real user flows
2. **Too complex**; designed for dedicated performance testing teams and difficult to adopt for small to medium sized teams

Hekaton is designed for the middle ground with a focus on simplicity (define test scenarios in a YAML file) while being more than just a simple load testing tool (model user journeys).

It is built around the concept of `Scenario`s  which represent the actions in a typical user journey through a system.  Rather than focusing on raw RPS, it's designed to allow teams to model real-world user journeys.

## Objectives

- Easy to model user journeys using simple YAML manifests
- Test definition stored as part of source control and executed remotely triggered from CI
- Support running multi-step test scenarios representing user journeys in parallel
- Support complex scenarios including performing authentication and processing of HTTP responses to extract parameters (headers, cookies)
- Concurrent processing of requests, responses, and results
- Pluggable output architecture to allow publishing results to console, S3, GitHub issue (as comment), etc.
- Support comparison of performance metrics over time to identify deviations
- Distributed processing of requests to simulate traffic from different origins

## Concepts

|Term|Definition|
|--|--|
|`Test`|A test defines a set of `Scenario`s that model user journeys|
|`Scenario`|A scenario encapsulates a series of steps to execute that represent actions that a user takes through a system.  For example, a scenario in e-commerce might be `browse landing page` → `add to cart` → `log in` → `checkout`|
|`Step`|Each `Scenario` is a collection of `Step`s which represent individual substantive HTTP requests that are generated by the user.  This does not include downloading static assets like images, JS files, CSS files, etc. (unless you want to!)|
|`VUser`|A virtual user represents one user performing the `Scenario`.|
|`Row`|`VUser`s can be generated dynamically or defined in an input CSV file (e.g. usernames, email, passwords, etc.)|
|`Pause`|Simulates how real users behave when interacting with the system.  Users will pause, read, scroll, and make decisions before acting.|
